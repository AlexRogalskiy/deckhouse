### Preparing environment
You have to create a service account with the editor role with the cloud provider so that Deckhouse can manage cloud resources. The detailed instructions for creating a service account with Yandex.Cloud are available in the provider's [documentation](https://cloud.yandex.com/en/docs/resource-manager/operations/cloud/set-access-bindings). Below, we will provide a brief overview of the necessary actions:

- Create a user named `candi`. The command response will contain its parameters:
  ```yaml
yc iam service-account create --name candi
id: <userId>
folder_id: <folderId>
created_at: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"
name: candi
```
- Assign the `editor` role to the newly created user:
  ```yaml
yc resource-manager folder add-access-binding <cloudname> --role editor --subject serviceAccount:<userId>
```
- Create a JSON file containing the parameters for user authorization in the cloud. These parameters will be used to log in to the cloud:
  ```yaml
yc iam key create --service-account-name candi --output candi-sa-key.json
```

### Preparing configuration
- Generate an SSH key on the local machine for accessing the cloud-based virtual machines. In Linux and macOS, you can generate a key using the `ssh-keygen` command-line tool. The public key must be included in the configuration file (it will be used for accessing nodes in the cloud).
- Select the layout â€“ the way how resources are located in the cloud *(there are several pre-defined layouts for each provider in Deckhouse)*. We will use the **WithoutNAT** layout for the Yandex.Cloud example. In this layout, NAT (of any kind) is not used, and each node is assigned a public IP.
- Define the three primary sections with parameters of the prospective cluster in the `config.yml` file:

{% offtopic title="config.yml for CE" %}
