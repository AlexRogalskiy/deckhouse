Prepare the installation configuration of the **Deckhouse Platform {% if page.revision == 'ee' %}Enterprise Edition{% else %}Community Edition{% endif %}**:
- Generate an SSH key on the local machine for accessing the cloud-based virtual machines. In Linux and macOS, you can generate a key using the `ssh-keygen` command-line tool. The public key must be included in the configuration file (it will be used for accessing nodes in the cloud).
- Select the layout â€“ the way how resources are located in the cloud *(there are several pre-defined layouts for each provider in Deckhouse Platform)*. Let's use the **Standard** layout in our example for Azure. In this layout:
    - A separate resource group is created for the cluster.
    - By default, one external IP address is dynamically allocated to each instance (it is used for Internet access only). Each IP has 64000 ports available for SNAT. The NAT Gateway (billing) is supported. With it, you can use static public IP addresses for SNAT. Public IP addresses can be assigned to master nodes and nodes created using Terraform. If the master does not have a public IP, an additional instance with a public IP (aka bastion) is required for installation tasks and access to the cluster. In this case, you will also need to configure peering between the cluster's VNet and bastion's VNet. Peering can also be configured between the cluster VNet and other VNets.
- Define the three primary sections with parameters of the prospective cluster in the `config.yml` file:
