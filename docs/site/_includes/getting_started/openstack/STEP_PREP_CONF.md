Prepare the installation configuration of the **Deckhouse Platform {% if page.revision == 'ee' %}Enterprise Edition{% else %}Community Edition{% endif %}**:
- Generate an SSH key on the installer machine for accessing the cloud-based virtual machines. In Linux and macOS, you can generate a key using the `ssh-keygen` command-line tool. The public key must be included in the configuration file (it will be used for accessing nodes in the cloud).

- Select your layout â€” the way how resources are located in the cloud *(there are several pre-defined layouts for each provider in Deckhouse Platform)*. For the Openstack example, we will use the **Standard** layout. In this layout, an internal cluster network is created with a gateway to the public network; the nodes do not have public IP addresses. A floating IP is assigned to the master node.

- Define the three primary sections with parameters of the prospective cluster in the `config.yml` file:

  ```yaml
  # general cluster parameters (ClusterConfiguration)
  # version of the Deckhouse API
  apiVersion: deckhouse.io/v1alpha1
  # type of the configuration section
  kind: ClusterConfiguration
  # type of the infrastructure: bare metal (Static) or Cloud (Cloud)
  clusterType: Cloud
  # cloud provider-related settings
  cloud:
    # type of the cloud provider
    provider: OpenStack
    # prefix to differentiate cluster objects (can be used, e.g., in routing)
    prefix: "mailru-demo"
  # address space of the cluster's pods
  podSubnetCIDR: 10.111.0.0/16
  # address space of the cluster's services
  serviceSubnetCIDR: 10.222.0.0/16
  # Kubernetes version to install
  kubernetesVersion: "1.19"
  # cluster domain (used for local routing)
  clusterDomain: "cluster.local"

      global:
        # the cluster name (it is used, e.g., in Prometheus alerts' labels)
        clusterName: somecluster
        # the cluster's project name (it is used for the same purpose as the cluster name)
        project: someproject
        modules:
          # template that will be used for system apps domains within the cluster
          # e.g., Grafana for %s.somedomain.com will be available as grafana.somedomain.com
          publicDomainTemplate: "%s.somedomain.com"
