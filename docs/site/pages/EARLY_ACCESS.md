While Deckhouse Platform has a vast history of being used internally in Flant and is [ready for production](en/about_us.html), it is still experiencing the final touches of becoming available as an end-user product.

That's why you might experience some issues for now, including the following:

-   The split of Platform into CE & EE editions is an undergoing process. The experimental modules (which are not recommended for general use yet) are also being decoupled.
-   Both official editions, CE and EE (without experimental modules), will become available not later than May 31st, 2021.
-   At the moment, you can install only the EE edition of Deckhouse Platform that includes experimental modules.
-   When your demo access is expired, you will be able to switch your installation to CE (relevant guidelines will follow) or purchase EE.
-   The code of the Platform is not available in its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/deckhouse/deckhouse) yet. It will be published not later than May 31st, 2021.
