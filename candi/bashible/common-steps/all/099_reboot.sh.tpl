  # * curl in CentOS can't read kubelet client certificate key from /var/lib/kubelet/pki/kubelet-client-current.pem due to libnss bug.
  # * wget in CentOS has no --method argument, so we cant use PATCH HTTP request.
  # The solution â€” to delete Lease object for our node and handle this event with Deckhouse hook modules/040-node-manager/hooks/node_lease_handler.
