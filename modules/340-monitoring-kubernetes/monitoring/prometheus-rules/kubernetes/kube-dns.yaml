        No working pods of kube-dns service exist in the cluster. DNS is not working!
        Applications can't get addresses of internal services and external domains.

        To debug the problem, use the following commands:
        1. `kubectl -n kube-system describe deployment -l k8s-app=kube-dns`
        2. `kubectl -n kube-system describe pod -l k8s-app=kube-dns`
      summary: Kube-dns or CoreDNS doesn't work.
