        Prometheus is unable to collect metrics from kube-dns. Thus its status is unknown.

        To debug the problem, use the following commands:
        1. `kubectl -n kube-system describe deployment -l k8s-app=kube-dns`
        2. `kubectl -n kube-system describe pod -l k8s-app=kube-dns`
      summary: Kube-dns or CoreDNS are not under monitoring.
